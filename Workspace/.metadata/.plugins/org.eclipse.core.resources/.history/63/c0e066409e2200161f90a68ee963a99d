Your gun flies out of its holster and is pointing straight at a junky skulking in the shadows. You've drawn your weapon so fast that he hasn't had time to realize you've noticed him. You messed up slightly, however, and in your 		haste managed to fire off a shot by accident. The needle-like projectile zips past the junky’s head close enough to singe his hair and deafen him for a couple of seconds. 
It then continues on to slam into the wall not far behind him, instantly pulverizing a chunk of concrete and leaving a fist-size hole in the wall. 

Despite that little screwup the situation isn't all that bad. You’re still standing, gun drawn and facing off against a man who, by the looks of it, seems to be armed with nothing more than a steel pipe.
Burned, half deaf and covered in concrete dust from the back of his head to his ass. He does the only sensible thing that comes to mind.
He promptly soils him self and runs away in sheer panic. You start walking slowly backwards on the train that just came in.
