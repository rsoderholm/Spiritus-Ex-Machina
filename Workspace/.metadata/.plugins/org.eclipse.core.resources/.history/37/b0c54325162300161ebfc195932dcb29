Resting a hand lightly on the gun in your holster, you stop walking and turn your head slightly to look at your would-be assailant from the corner of one eye.
"Can I help you?", Your voice is low and cold. Your eyes never blink or stray from the target. Whatever he had planned to do, your words seem to have frozen him dead in his tracks.
You can see him clearly now. Tall, skinny, dark haired, sunken eye, sallow skin and wielding a steel pipe. His cracked lips move as if trying to speak but no words come out..
This idiot was gonna try n' shake me down
Annoyed now, you examine your options in your head..
I don't have time to arrest this moron and you start to walk backwards to the oncoming train.#
Board the train#
