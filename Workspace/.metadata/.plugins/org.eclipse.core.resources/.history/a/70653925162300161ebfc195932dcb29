Your gun flies out of its holster and is pointing straight at a junky skulking in the shadows. You've drawn your weapon so fast that he hasn't had time to realize you've noticed him. You messed up slightly, however, and in your haste managed to fire off a shot by accident. The needle-like projectile zips past the junky’s head close enough to singe his hair and deafen him for a couple of seconds. It then continues on to slam into the wall not far behind him, instantly pulverizing a chunk of concrete and leaving a fist-size hole in the wall. He promptly soils him self and runs away in sheer panic. You start walking slowly backwards on the train that just came in.#
