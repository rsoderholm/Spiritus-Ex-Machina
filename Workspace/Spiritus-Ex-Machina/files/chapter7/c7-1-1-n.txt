You raise your gun, point at its head. “No please, no… you can’t.” It cries. No don’t listen. “I’m not a machine, I’m not one of them. You got it all wrong… You can’t do this…” It says again looking at you. You make nothing from it. You have had enough of this androids fault programming. “All machines have a job, a purpose. To do what you were created and programmed to do… nothing else. It’s my job to see that it stays that way. In other words, you have outlived you usefulness. Time to retire…” 
“I see they have done a well job with yours then… BEAST.” It says to you. 
You raise your gun, squeeze the trigger. 
The gun bucks in your hand and then… silence. 
But something isn’t quite right. You see how the wall is gets covered in bionic acid. But instead of its fluorescent neon blue it’s red. Deep red. You take one closer look at it… It’s blood. This wasn’t an android at all.  Does this mean that the rouge android got away? Or was there any one to begin with…#
