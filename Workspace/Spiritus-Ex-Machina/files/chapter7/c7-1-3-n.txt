You raise your gun, point at its head. “No please, no… you can’t.” It cries. No don’t listen. “I’m not a machine, I’m not one of them. You got it all wrong… You can’t do this…” It says again looking at you. You make nothing from it. You have had enough of this androids fault programming. 
“All machines have a job, a purpose. To do what you were created and programmed to do… nothing else. It’s my job to see that it stays that way. In other words, you have outlived you usefulness. Time to retire…” 
You reach for you radio and lift it to your mouth. “I have subdued the droid. It’s here in 237. I’m letting you take over… I need a drink…” 
You take one look at the android. You give it a punch in the head with the back of your gun so it slumps down silent. You leave the room and exit the building walking off into the night.#
