You turn away and stare out towards the people around you running around. You notice some people are in clear chock, but you make nothing from it. You continue through the crime scene, down back towards the apartment building you where before. You see a few officers outside of it. Before reaching it you mutter to yourself:#
“Great… more flatfoots...”#
c5-3-3-1-n
“Doesn’t these guys have a doughnut shop to rob?”#
c5-3-3-1-n
“Urrgh… you officer-scum”#
c5-3-3-1-n
“An audience just what I need… SHOWTIME!”#
