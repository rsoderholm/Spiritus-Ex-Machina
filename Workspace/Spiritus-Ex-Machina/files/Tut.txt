You take the stairs down to the subway station, trying to brace your self as much as possible for the
stench. Gravel and bits of broken glass crunch under foot as you sidestep the small piles of detritus
scatteredhaphazardly all over the station.

other animals have mixed together to form a smell that defies any attempt at ignore it.HEJ
